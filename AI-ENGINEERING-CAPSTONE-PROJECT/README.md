## About the repository:
1. This repository has been described the AI Capstone project offered by IBM(https://www.coursera.org/learn/ai-deep-learning-capstone/home/welcome).
2. The goal of this capstone project is to classify between the cracked and not cracked stone image using the resnet model. Also, understand the performance of the model using various visualization techniques such as tensorboard, onfusion matrix, classification report.


## Dataset used:
Dataset has been provided by IBM, which consists of cracked and not cracked images. Total number of the images are 40,000 images.
The links to download the dataset has followed below:

## Result visualization:

Following results are the performance of the model that has been trained for 4 epochs. And due to the longer computation time, samller number of training and validation samples has been used for the model (train : validation = 10,000 : 5,000)

## Course 1: Machine Learning with Python
This course dives into the basics of machine learning using an approachable, and well-known programming language, Python.
This course explained 2 major components, which are the purpose of the machine learning, and general overview of machine learning topics. First this course has reviewed why we need the machine learning and where can we apply. Second, this course gives general overview of Machine Learning topics such as supervised vs unsupervised learning, model evaluation, and Machine Learning algorithms.


## Course 2: Scalable Machine Learning on Big Data using Apache Spark
This course empower you with the skills to scale data science and machine learning (ML) tasks on Big Data sets using Apache Spark.
Apache Spark is an open source framework that leverages cluster computing and distributed storage to process extremely large data sets in an efficient and cost effective manner. Therefore an applied knowledge of working with Apache Spark is a great asset and potential differentiator for a Machine Learning engineer

## Course 3: Introduction to Deep Learning & Neural Networks with Keras
This course introduce you to the field of deep learning and help you answer many questions that people are asking nowadays, like what is deep learning, and how do deep learning models compare to artificial neural networks. Also, You will learn about the different deep learning models and build your first deep learning model using the Keras library.

## Course 4: Deep Neural Networks with PyTorch
The course teach you how to develop deep learning models using Pytorch.
The course has start with Pytorch's tensors and Automatic differentiation package. Then each section will cover different models starting off with fundamentals such as Linear Regression, and logistic/softmax regression. Followed by Feedforward deep neural networks, the role of different activation functions, normalization and dropout layers. Then Convolutional Neural Networks and Transfer learning will be covered. Finally, several other Deep learning methods will be covered.

## Course 5: Building Deep Learning Models with TensorFlow
The majority of data in the world is unlabeled and unstructured.
Shallow neural networks cannot easily capture relevant structure in, for instance, images, sound, and textual data. Deep networks are capable of discovering hidden structures within this type of data. In this course youâ€™ll use TensorFlow library to apply deep learning to different data types in order to solve real world problems.

## Course 6: AI Capstone Project with Deep Learning
In this capstone, deep learning knowledge and expertise has been applied to a real world challenge.
They used a library of their choice to develop and test a deep learning model. They load and pre-process data for a real problem, build the model and validate it. Learners will then present a project report to demonstrate the validity of their model and their proficiency in the field of Deep Learning.
